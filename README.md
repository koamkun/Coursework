## ðŸ“˜ Description

The **Employee Payroll Management System** is a Java-based application that allows users to manage payroll records for employees. The system handles the creation, reading, updating, and deletion of employee records, and calculates net salaries based on base pay, tax rates, and deductions. Data is saved in a CSV file to allow persistence across sessions.

## ðŸ“š Documentation

### ðŸ”¢ Algorithms

- **Net Salary Calculation**  
  ```netPay = baseSalary - (baseSalary * taxRate) - deductions```

### ðŸ§± Data Structures

- `HashMap<Integer, Employee>` â€” for fast access and update of employee records by ID.
- `ArrayList<String>` (temporary, for reading file lines).
- `Scanner` â€” for console input and file reading.

### ðŸ§© Functions/Modules

- `Employee` class: holds employee attributes and logic.
- `PayrollSystem` class: manages employee operations and file I/O.
- `loadFromCSV()`, `saveToCSV()` â€” for persistence.
- `createEmployee()`, `updateEmployee()`, `deleteEmployee()`, etc.

### ðŸ§— Challenges

- Managing unique IDs across sessions.
- Ensuring CSV format is robust and parseable.
- Input validation to avoid exceptions.
- Updating employee data without GUI.

## ðŸ§ª Test Cases and Outputs

### âœ… Sample Input 1:
- Name: Alice Johnson  
- Base Salary: 5000  
- Tax Rate: 0.2  
- Deductions: 200

### âœ… Expected Output:
ID: 1 Name: Alice Johnson Base Salary: $5000.0 Tax Withheld: $1000.0 Deductions: $200.0 Net Pay: $3800.0
